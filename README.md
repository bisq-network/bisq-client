# Bisq Client

A client for the [Bisq network](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq) supporting **Android**, **iOS**, and **Desktop** platforms.

Note, a **Web** platform will be added at a later date when "Compose for Web" becomes more mature.
The web version of **SqlDelight** (the most popular local database for *Kotlin MultiPlatform*) is also at a very early stage,
as currently the database cannot even be saved persistently.
It might take until the **end of 2021** before it makes sense to start work on a proper Compose for Web app.
